# harold
A Discord Notification Bot

## Why?
When people join a voice channel I wanted to know who it was, have some sort of announcement if you will, that way I wouldn't have to alt tab to check who was there and stop my current train of thought. That's when I decided to create Harold here. He let's the server know when people join the channel, start playing games and more.

## Features
